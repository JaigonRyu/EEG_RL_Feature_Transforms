# EEG_RL_Feature_Transforms

**Description**: Our project used the BCI Competition Dataset to test a reinforcement learning based feature transformation approach. For our RL Algorithm we used PPO to find optimal feature vectors for generalization. We tested with 8 subjects splitting them into three random trials of 5 train and 3 test subjects. After that The performance is measured by classification accuracy and generalization error on unseen subjects. We were able to get the lowest accuracy scores up to a good baseline. This shows promising results for the technique in the future.
